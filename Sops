The dependency `spring-web:5.3.39` is required to support the current build process and ensure compatibility with existing project requirements. However, this version is linked to CVE-2016-100027, which involves improper input validation that could lead to remote code execution under specific conditions. Despite this vulnerability, the version is critical for build stability and can be safely used with the following compensating controls.
CVSS Information:
CVSS Score: 8.1
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N
Business Justification:
We request the use of `spring-web:5.3.39` as it resolves previous vulnerabilities and is necessary for the successful completion of the build process. The risks associated with CVE-2016-100027 have been evaluated, and the following compensating controls mitigate the potential threats sufficiently.
Compensating Controls Implemented:
The following compensating controls have been implemented to mitigate the risks associated with CVE-2016-100027:
1. **Input Validation:**
   - Strict validation for externally provided URLs.
   - Only whitelisted domains and schemes allowed (e.g., https, http).
   - Regex-based domain checks implemented for proper host validation.
2. **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
   - Configured to block open redirect and SSRF attack patterns.
3. **Regular Security Scans:**
   - Automated vulnerability scans scheduled weekly using approved tools.
