The application development got blocked as the Apache Struts 2 Tiles Plugin was quarantined in the Nexus repository due to a critical vulnerability in its dependency XStream < 1.4.21 (CVE-2024-47072, CVSS: 9.8).
The vulnerability involves a Denial of Service (DoS) condition triggered by manipulating the binary input stream (BinaryStreamDriver class).
The Kenna contextualization is High due to the potential impact on application availability.
This vulnerability is exploitable only when deserializing untrusted binary data.
The etransfer application does not use the vulnerable methods or classes (Evidence attached for references).
The app team confirmed Struts2 usage with a patched version that is compatible with Java 17 and actively maintained.
Mitigating/Compensating Controls
Upgrade the Apache Struts 2 Tiles Plugin to a version that includes XStream 1.4.21 or later, where this vulnerability is patched.
Verify that no deserialization of untrusted binary data occurs in the application.
Implement AWS WAF 2.0 rules to block deserialization attempts at the firewall level.
Conduct static code analysis and dependency scans to ensure no vulnerable versions are present.
Residual Risk after Accounting for Compensating Controls
Residual Risk: Medium
(Refer to slide #3 for residual risk assessment summary.)

This version now clearly reflects the issue with Apache Struts 2 and its dependency on XStream. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
