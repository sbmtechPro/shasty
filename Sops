Asset Information:
- **Asset ID:** <Enter Asset ID>
- **Asset Name:** <Enter Asset Name>
- **CVSS Score:** <Enter CVSS Score>
- **Affected Dependency:** spring-web:5.3.39
- **Current Impact:** Build failure due to dependency quarantine.
Business Justification:
We require the use of `spring-web:5.3.39` as it is a critical dependency for our application build. The version provides necessary functionality and stability required for the current development cycle. Blocking this dependency is causing build failures and impacting project timelines.
Compensating Controls Implemented:
To mitigate the potential risks associated with the identified vulnerability, the following compensating controls are in place:
1. **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF is implemented to monitor and block potential threats exploiting this vulnerability.
2. **Regular Vulnerability Scanning:** Automated scans are performed weekly using `<Tool Name>` to identify new vulnerabilities.
3. **Code Review and Secure Development Practices:** Secure coding practices are enforced through peer code reviews and static analysis tools like `<Tool Name>`.
4. **Runtime Protection (RASP):** Runtime Application Self-Protection tools are integrated for real-time monitoring and threat mitigation.
5. **Network Segmentation:** The application is hosted in a segmented network to limit lateral movement in case of an exploit.
6. **Patch Management:** Dependency monitoring and patching through tools like Dependabot/Snyk are regularly enforced.
Request for Unquarantine Approval:
We have verified the effectiveness of the above controls and believe they provide sufficient protection against potential threats related to `spring-web:5.3.39`. We request approval to unquarantine this dependency for build stability and project progress.
