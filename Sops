Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CA Ticket Handling and Escalation
Purpose:
This SOP provides guidelines for handling Corrective Action (CA) tickets, ensuring that the appropriate escalation paths are followed, unnecessary tickets are avoided, and a smooth pre-release and cleanup process is maintained.

Scope:
This procedure applies to all team members responsible for managing CA tickets, reaching out to relevant teams, and confirming compliance standards before release.

1. Identifying the Type of CA Ticket
Check the CA Ticket Source:
Each CA ticket will be labeled as either AppSec or Infra.
AppSec Tickets: Escalate to the VM (Vulnerability Management) team.
Infra Tickets: Escalate to the VITM (Vulnerability Infrastructure Management) team.
Before escalating to any team:

First Contact Your Security Advisor (SA):
Always consult your Security Advisor to investigate the issue. The Security Advisor will determine if further escalation to the VM or VITM teams is necessary.
2. Handling CA Tickets After a Clean Scan Post-Release
7-Day Waiting Period for Auto-Closure:
After a clean scan following a release, CA tickets should automatically close within 7 days.

Action if the Ticket Remains Open After 7 Days:
If the CA ticket is still open after 7 days, reach out to your Security Advisor to investigate before opening any new tickets.

3. Opening a CA Ticket with First Responders
The team should open a CA ticket with First Responders under these specific circumstances:

SCA, DAST, or SAST Scan Failures:
If SCA (Software Composition Analysis), DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing), or SAST (Static Application Security Testing) scans are failing.
Before opening a ticket:

Consult Your Security Advisor (SA):
Your Security Advisor should investigate the root cause of the scan failure. Proceed to open a CA ticket only after confirmation from the Security Advisor.
Additional Case: Zero North Cleanup Request

Zero North Cleanup:
The team can open a Jira ticket with First Responders if they need Zero North cleanup under the following conditions:
A component associated with an active CA ticket has been retired or is no longer in use.
The team wants to remove this component to close the CA ticket.
Before opening a Zero North cleanup Jira ticket:

Coordinate with the DCR (Data Component Repository) Team:

Confirm the component has been archived or deleted by the DCR team.
Obtain verification from the DCR team.
Attach Documentation to the Jira Ticket:

Include an archive request and screenshots that confirm the component has been removed.
Attach these documents to the Jira ticket to support the Zero North cleanup request.
4. Handling Overdue CA Tickets
If a CA Ticket is Past Due:
For any CA ticket that has exceeded its due date, request your VP to complete the disposition tracker and provide an explanation for the delay in resolving the ticket.
5. Reassigning a CA Ticket
If you receive a CA ticket that does not belong to your team, follow these steps to reassign it:

Review the Ticket:
Confirm the CA ticket does not apply to your teamâ€™s scope.

Update the Assignment Group:

Navigate to the Assignment Group field in the CA ticket.
Update it to the correct team (e.g., VM Team for AppSec, VITM Team for Infra).
Save the Changes:
After updating the Assignment Group, hit Save at the top of the CA ticket.

6. Pre-Release Scan Requirements and P2P Approval Process
Before submitting for release:

Ensure all components have completed the required scans and are compliant with:
DAST API
DAST
SCA
SAST
Mandatory Pre-Release Checks:

Run All Required Scans:
Conduct and verify clean results from all scans before submitting for P2P (Peer-to-Peer) approval.

High-Risk External Facing Assets:
For assets classified as very high risk and external-facing, P2P approval will not proceed without confirmed compliance.

Scan Results and PTO Approval:
The scan results will determine if the component is compliant for PTO (Permission to Operate) approval.

7. Scan Timeline
14 Days Pre-Release:
Run all required scans 14 days before the release to avoid delays in P2P approval due to unexpected scan issues.

Within 15 Days Pre-Release:
If scans are run within 15 days of the release, ensure results are available and ready for P2P approval.

8. Special Consideration for Assets Without Code or Internal URLs
No Code or Internal URL Assets:
If an asset lacks code and internal URLs but is flagged for DAST, SCA, or SAST in the CMD (Component Metadata), work with the team to update the CMD non-core bar attributes to avoid unnecessary scans.
9. Handling EVR CA Tickets (Manually Closed Process)
EVR (External Vulnerability Response) CA Tickets:
EVR tickets require manual closure. These are triggered by alerts from:
Internal security teams
Third-party security monitoring vendors
Steps for Handling EVR CA Tickets:

Investigate the Alert:
Verify and resolve the alert that initiated the EVR ticket.

Manually Close the Ticket:
After confirming that the issue has been resolved, manually close the EVR ticket, as these do not close automatically.

10. Handling CA Tickets Not Auto-Closing After 7 Days Post-Release
If a CA ticket does not automatically close within 7 days post-release, follow these steps:

Check Scan Execution:
Verify that all required scans were completed on the component specified in the CA ticket, and that clean results were obtained.

Verify the Component in the CA Ticket:
If the component name in the CA ticket is different from the scanned component:

Update the Component Name in the CA ticket.
Rerun the scans on the correct component.
Manually Close the Ticket if Necessary:
After verifying that the correct component has been scanned with clean results, manually close the ticket if it does not close automatically.
