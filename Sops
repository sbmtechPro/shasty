We attempted to run a DAST scan on the Home Path application, but the scan was failing. To address this, we opened a Jira ticket to inform the FR team about the inability to obtain the DAST results. Upon review, Normula and Kinnera Reddy from the FR team confirmed that the application was not eligible for a DAST scan.

As per their guidance (as also reflected in the Jira ticket and attached comments), we updated the non-core bar attributes to indicate "DAST Eligibility: NO." For your reference, the PTO number associated with this update is 222222, and the RTM number is 3333.

This series of actions explains why the application was marked as ineligible for a DAST scan. Please let me know if further clarification is required.
